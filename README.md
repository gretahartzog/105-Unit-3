# 105-Unit-3
### Overview

This is a repository containing instructional materials and datasets for professor Gotzler's fall 2022 sections of English 105 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The repository contains 3 python notebooks that give instructions to the basic covering of topics in coding with Python3, and beginner modules on using the Pandas package for data analysis.


This repository also contains a raw data set that was adapted using the excellent lessons created by the staff at the research hub of UNC's Davis Library and the tutorials described above. 


These materials contain data in my notebooks and coding work targeted for people that are interested in data on adult obesity and food environment index throughout the counties in North Carolina. The potential this data set has is to educate people and to be used as evidence for a serious topic.


### Data Chosen/Purpose
The data in this repository was generated by the Public County Health Data. It consists of many health related issues in all 50 states, including each county in those states. 

The data set allows you to edit the rows and columns to simplify it a specific topic you want to look at. Since the data set is so big you must be able to easily edit it to make it more accesible. 

It is encouraged that users will find data they are interested in and use this repository to edit the columns and rows to make it easier to understand. 

In this repository you will find data from the Public County Health data that has already been simplified but users should follow the steps given in Data.ipynb ( http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/Desktop/unit%203%20project/Data.ipynb ) to adapt their own sets. 


### Analysis

Shown below is a graphical image of adult obesity and the food environment index levels in North Carolina. You can see that the levels consistantly have a strong pattern of being extremely high in almost every county.
